I am currently a Ph.D. student in the College of Computer Science and Technology at Hangzhou Dianzi University. My research interests include retrieval and database.

My current research focuses on the following topics:

- Graph-based approximate nearest neighbor search algorithms
- Cross-modal retrieval
- Vector database and its applications in large language models
