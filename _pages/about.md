About me
======
I am now a Ph.D. candidate in the College of Computer Science and Technology at Hangzhou Dianzi University. I enjoy working with labmates of [KGLab](https://kglab.hdu.edu.cn/#/home). My current research focuses on the management and analyses of high-dimensional data, including:

- Graph-based vector indexing for approximate nearest neighbor search
- Multi-modal retrieval and analyses
- High-dimensional data storage and compression
- Vector database and its AI applications (e.g., Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG))
